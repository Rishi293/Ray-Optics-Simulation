# Ray Optics Simulation
Simulate reflection and refraction of light.

## Features
- Simulate various light sources: ray, beam, and point source
- Simulate reflection in linear, circular, and parabolic mirror
- Simulate beam splitter
- Simulate refraction in linear or circular interfaces, including both refracted and reflected rays
- Simulate mixture of colors and chromatic dispersion<sup>beta</sup>  
- Simulate ideal lens/mirror, which obeys lens/mirror equation
- View extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- View real images, virtual images, and virtual objects directly
- View images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance, angular, energy flow, and momentum flow measurements
- Export as SVG diagram
